"""`halyard doctor` — answer "why is everything being denied" in one command.

Every piece of this system fails closed, which is correct and which makes a
misconfiguration look exactly like a working system refusing you. A bridge
pointed at the wrong address denies every command with a message about a port,
and there is no error anywhere to find.

So this walks the same path a hook does and says which step broke — and where
each setting came from, because "unreachable at 8787" is not useful on its own.
